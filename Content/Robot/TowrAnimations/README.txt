These animations were generated using the Unreal "Sequence Recorder".
 
Select the "Robot" Actor and click "Add". Then make sure you hit the "Play" button in the 
Editor first, then the "Record" button in the Sequence Recorder. This otherwise causes problems. 

In the Recording settings, make sure you have:
"Record in World Space" -> checked
"Remove Root Animation" -> unchecked (because we want the root to move).
